# bikesharing

## Overview
<!--Overview of the statistical analysis: The purpose of the analysis is well defined. (5 pt) -->
The purpose of this challenge was to use Tableau to create visualized data for an upcoming bike-sharing data. Data used from New York City was used to do a statistical analysis to see if starting a bike-sharing company in a different city would be a beneficial idea.

## Results
<!--Results:

There are at least seven visualizations for the NYC Citibike analysis (7 pt)
There is a description of the results for each visualization (7 pt) -->
* Checkout Times for Users

In Figure 1, it shows the length of time that bikes are checked out. The graph shows that the total number of bikes as well as the duration of the trip per rider.

* Trips by Weekday for Each Hour

In this visualization, the goal was to show the number of bike trips by each hour of the day. Figure 3 shows the results by using a heatmap.

* Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)

Using the same approach as above, the heatmap in Figure 4 is very similar but uses gender data as well. This heatmap is showing the trips by gender for a weekday per hour.

* Trips by Gender by Weekday

In Figure 5, a heatmap was created to show trips broken down by gender for each day of the week by each rider.

Figure 5.

* Top Starting Locations

In this visualization, the map shows the top starting locations for using bikes. The different shades of colors shows the most and least popular locations.

* Top Ending Locations

In Figure 7, the map shows the top ending locations for using bikes.Just like above, the different shades of colors shows the most and least popular locations.

## Summary

<!--There is a high-level summary of the results and two additional visualizations are suggested for future analysis (5 pt) -->

Starting a bike sharing service could be a good business adventure. When looking at the data, we can see that a majority of the users are using the bikes for around 20 minutes.
